# Google Search

front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

Built with Bootstrap

---

### Three pages

- one for Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.

- _links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search or back to Google Search._

### Query Text

- _On the Google Search page, you can type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page._

### Query Images.

- _On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page._

### Query Advanced.

- _On the Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)_
- _When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user should be taken to search results page for their given query._

  - _Find pages with… “all these words:”_

  - _Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”_
  - _Find pages with… “any of these words:”_
  - _Find pages with… “none of these words:”_

### Appearance.

- _Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned._
- _Like Google’s own, your search bar should be centered with rounded corners. The search button should also be centered, and should be beneath the search bar._
- _Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button should be blue with white text._

### Lucky Search.

- _Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page._

### Aesthetics

- _The css matches Google’s own aesthetics as best as possible._
